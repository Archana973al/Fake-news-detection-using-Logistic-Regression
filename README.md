# ‚ö†Ô∏è Fake-news-detection-using-Logistic-Regression

# Overview
Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age. This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. 

## The notebook walks through the following steps:

### 1. üì• Data Loading
```python
fake_news = pd.read_csv("fake.csv")
real_news = pd.read_csv("true.csv")
```
### 2.üßπ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.

### 3.üî¢ Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

### 4.ü§ñ Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression model on the processed data.

### 5.üìä Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

## Results
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e62c02a-1578-40fe-9ad2-a8ce47bf449a)

The Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of 98.7% on the test dataset. The classification report provides detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for both "fake" and "real" news classes.

## üìäConfusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions:

True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted fake news.

True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted real news.

False Positives (FP): Real news incorrectly predicted as fake.

False Negatives (FN): Fake news incorrectly predicted as real.
